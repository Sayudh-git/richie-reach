# Richie Reach

**Signal-First Outbound Prospecting Platform**

Richie Reach transforms how B2B teams approach outbound sales by capturing fresh engagement signals from public LinkedIn activity and delivering ICP-filtered, enriched prospects directly to your outbound stack.

## 🎯 What is Richie Reach?

Richie Reach is a signal intelligence platform that monitors public LinkedIn engagement to identify prospects showing active buying intent. Rather than cold outreach to static databases, we deliver weekly queues of prospects who have recently engaged with topics relevant to your solution—complete with context for personalized outreach.

- **🔗 Stack Integration** – Direct delivery via CSV, Clay tables, or webhooks to Smartlead, HubSpot, Salesforce, and more
- **💰 Credit Savings** – Save 60%+ on enrichment credits by filtering before enriching
